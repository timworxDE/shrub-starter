    <h1>ðŸŒ¿ Shrub: Static pages, made easy</h1>
    <p>
        Shrub is a lightweight PHP framework that specializes in simplifying the creation and management of static websites.
        As an extension of the Leaf PHP framework, Shrub combines the simplicity of Leaf with powerful, modern web tools to take the burden off developers who need fast, low-maintenance static websites.
        At the heart of the simplification is the Blade template engine, which allows you to create dynamic, reusable components for your static pages, making writing HTML intuitive and efficient.
        Another feature is the use of Vite for optimized bundling of CSS and JavaScript files.
